# Professional README Generator

![MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/LICENSE-MIT-blue)

## Description

This will take instructions in and create a README.md file in the working directory. I don't find this to be a robust generator the way I coded it, because it doesn't actually require the fields to be entered. There isn't a way to enter fields that have paragraph breaks. In short, it is poor user experience. However, it does what it is supposed to do and it will take in a number of arguments and format them in to a README file. The user can always go back and refresh it slightly once it is created.

## Installation

Pick a directory to store it in. Write a shell script in BASH that will call the function from anywhere.

## Usage

This will prompt the user to enter a number of arguments, some marked required, some recommended and others optional. It will then take these arguments and format them in to a proper README document that will display nicely in GitHub.
